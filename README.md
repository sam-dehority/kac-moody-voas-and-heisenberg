# kac-moody-voas-and-heisenberg

These sage worksheets contain methods to 
manipulate Heisenberg algebras, Kac-Moody algebras, and 
even lattice vertex operator algebras. 

A few highlights: 

- Compute an explicit basis for the root subspace of a Kac-Moody algebra
- Compute the action of a the Heisenberg algebra associated to a vector space on the Fock module
- Calculate the action of a vertex operator in an even lattice VOA in the basic representation.
